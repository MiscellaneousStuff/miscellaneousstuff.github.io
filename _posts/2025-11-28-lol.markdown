## Introduction

Recently there has been a massive development for League of Legends game playing AI...

Elon Musk has issued a public challenge to beat the worlds best League of Legends team by the end of 2026 using Grok 5.
There are also two very interesting restrictions for the challenge:
1. Can only look at the monitor with a camera, seeing no more than what a person with 20/20 vision would see.
2. Reaction latency and click rate no faster than human.

The second criteria is to avoid the issue of the bot simply out "APMing" humans, in the sense that the bot has higher mechanical precision and reaction
speeds and can therefore mathematically calculate the perfect way of avoiding damage. Most would agree this isn't a display of interesting behaviour,
but rather a "hydrolic press" way of beating humans.

However the first criteria is more interesting, that the input into the bot is simply just the raw visual feed from the game. This departs from
other frontier game playing systems such as OpenAI Five and AlphaStar which were provided raw data from the game using an API. This means that
Grok 5 will also have to learn how to process visual information, segment different objects in view and many other complex visual processing skills.
Presumably Grok will also have the same viewport restrictions which humans have, so the bot would also have to pan the camera over to areas of interest
as well??

Above we can see the architecture of OpenAI Five, the architecture of the system which beat the world champions at Dota 2 in 2019. The
section in blue is dedicated purely to processing each of the individual units in the game and directly integrates complex spatial-visual
information, along with semantic information per each unit. Grok 5 will have to learn to process similar visual information for League of Legends.
