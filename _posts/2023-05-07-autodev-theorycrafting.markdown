## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, Auto-GPT has emerged as a groundbreaking "AI agent" that can autonomously pursue goals by decomposing them into sub-tasks and leveraging the internet and other tools. With its impressive abilities to write, debug, test, and edit code, Auto-GPT has the potential to revolutionize various industries. However, it is not without its limitations, including confabulatory "hallucinations," staying on task, and effectively decomposing tasks.

In this blog post, we propose an innovative approach to address these limitations and further enhance Auto-GPT's capabilities: tapping into the vast knowledge stored in YouTube tutorials and other visual demonstrations. By harnessing the power of speech recognition and decomposing video content into a graph of actions, we aim to create a more robust and efficient AI agent that can better understand and replicate tasks to achieve its overarching goals. Join us as we explore this exciting new frontier and discuss how visual learning can elevate Auto-GPT to new heights.
