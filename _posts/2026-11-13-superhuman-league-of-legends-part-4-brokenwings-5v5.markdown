## Overview

In the [last](https://miscellaneousstuff.github.io/2026/11/04/superhuman-league-of-legends-part-3-live.html) post,
we focused on porting our findings from Brokenwings to modern League of Legends (patch 26.19). We managed to create
a faster than real-time simulator for League of Legends which had similar throughput to OpenAI Five.

Now we want to graduate up to full 5v5 games. However before porting over more of modern League of Legends to our
gameserver, we instead want to validate two things: \
1. Scaling up fastsim to the full 5v5 game mode \
2. Determining if our current RL methods can handle the full 5v5 game mode given that its game-tree complexity
is far higher than a simple mid lane Ezreal 1v1

## Why are we going back to Brokenwings?

At this stage we're confident we can train 1v1 agents, it's just a matter of compute and time. However, have
we actually tested our core hypothesis yet? Do we have any idea how much compute is required to train 5v5 agents
for League of Legends and do we know if our fastsim throughput gains hold for the full game, not just a 1v1
minigame involving a few minion waves, two champions and two towers?

To answer this, we're going back to brokenwings as it is a *faithful enough* implementation of the modern game
and helps us answer our fundamental questions. Unlike the modern game server where we don't have the source
code, brokenwings is open source which means we don't have to worry about the additional overhead of validating
the fidelity of our game servers implementation. We only have to ensure that we've transpiled the existing game
server faithfully into a more efficient implementation.

This journey lead us to three distinct phases...

## Phase 1: Making 5v5 fast

This stage involved making the 5v5 fastsim version of Brokenwings as fast as our GH200 hardware could possibly run.
In the end, here is how much each method improved environment and training throughput.

| Setup | Ticks/s | Decisions/s | Agent-steps/s | Game-years per day |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Real time, 30 Hz, one game | 30 | 7.5 | 75 | 0.003 |
| C# server, step mode, one game | 735 | 184 | 1.8k | 0.07 |
| C# server, step mode, 64 games | 18.8k | 4.7k | 47k | 1.7 |
| Numba simulator, 4,096 games | 313k | 78k | 783k | 29 |
| Rust engine, 2,048 games | 560k | 140k | 1.4 M | 51 |

To start with, our fully working Brokenwings game server with our custom RL bridge could already run full games.
Earlier in April we focused on speeding up the game server by stepping each game tick instead of running at 30hz.

## So where do we go from here?

As we're now able to train 5v5 agents on modest hardware, in the next part we will work on fully porting
10 champions on modern League of Legends for patch 26.19 and training 5v5 agents on the full game.
