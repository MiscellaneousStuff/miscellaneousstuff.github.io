## Introduction

This post is the first of a three part series exploring my journey involving
modern lip reading AI. The posts are arranged as follows:
- Part 1: Background and Uusing lip reading to win $100k at a hackathon!
- Part 2: Another hackathon improving upon real-world performance

## Background

Later during my MEng Computer Science course in 2023, I had an action recognition module.
This module involved using computer vision to build up basic datasets and classify actions.
However, I wanted to go a step further and explore the state-of-the-art in an interesting
and novel domain.

This is where I discovered visual speech recognition, otherwise known as "lip-reading".
This was an interesting
