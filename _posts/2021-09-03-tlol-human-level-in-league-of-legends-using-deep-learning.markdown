## Introduction

This post explores how to extract information from League of Legends replay files,
converting the extracted information into a format suitable for Jupyter Notebook,
exploring the data within the replays, visualising the data and intuitions about
the data. Recent approaches at creating human level MOBA deep learning agents
are also briefly explored with the key ideas being related to creating a human-level
League of Legends AI.
