## Introduction

This post explores how to extract information from League of Legends replay files,
converting the extracted information into a format suitable for Jupyter Notebook,
exploring the data within the replays, visualising the data and intuitions about
the data. Recent approaches at creating human level MOBA deep learning agents
are also briefly explored with the key ideas being related to creating a human-level
League of Legends AI.

## Initial Ideas

### League of Legends Replays

The previous posts highlighted the main difficulties with creating human level game
playing AIs. The central issue with all of these systems was having enough high
quality data to learn from. It is highly recommended to read [part 1](https://miscellaneousstuff.github.io/project/2021/09/01/tlol-human-level-in-league-of-legends-using-deep-learning.html)
and [part 2](https://miscellaneousstuff.github.io/project/2021/09/02/tlol-human-level-in-league-of-legends-using-deep-learning.html)
of this series for better context going forward if you are not already familiar
with the [history of League of Legends AI systems](https://miscellaneousstuff.github.io/project/2021/09/01/tlol-human-level-in-league-of-legends-using-deep-learning.html) or [game playing AI systems](https://miscellaneousstuff.github.io/project/2021/09/02/tlol-human-level-in-league-of-legends-using-deep-learning.html).

For instance, recent AI systems which were built to
play board games could directly simulate the games as the rules governing board
games such as Chess and Go are very simple to implement on CPUs and those board
games only contain a limited number of overall moves per game. An average Chess
game only contains 40 moves per game whereas an average game of Go contains
