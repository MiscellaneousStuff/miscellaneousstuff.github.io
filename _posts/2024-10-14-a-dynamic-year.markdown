## Introduction

This post is 10 months from the last one, and what a wild year it has been so far! In that time
I transitioned heavily away from consulting on the side and doing personal AI research after graduating, to competing in hackathons,
forming companies with others and learning a lot about business, marketing, sales and interpersonal
relationships along the way.

## Overview

To recap, let's go over what has happened in the last 12 months...
