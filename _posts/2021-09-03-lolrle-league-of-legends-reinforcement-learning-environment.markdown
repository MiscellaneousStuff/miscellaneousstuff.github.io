## Introduction
This post introduces the League of Legends v4.20 Reinforcement Learning Environment
(LoLRLE). LoLRLE is a python-based reinforcement learning environment created for
an emulation of an older version of the wildly popular MOBA game, League of Legends.
LoLRLE uses patch 4.20, which was released on 20th November 2014, as the project is
based on the open-source project, LeagueSandbox. LeagueSandbox is a project with the
goal of creating an open-source emulation of the League of Legends game server from
patch 4.20 as that was the last patch before the encryption of the game packets which
made reverse-engineering the functionality of the game far more difficult from that
point onwards. LeagueSandbox is used as the game server for the LoLRLE project as it
is the most mature League of Legends game server emulation which is currently open-source.

The purpose of this post is to explain the engineering decisions which were made when
creating LoLRLE, attempts at creating machine learning agents using the framework,
the current status of the project, and the aim of the project going forward.
