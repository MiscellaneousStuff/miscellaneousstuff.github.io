## Introduction

Is it possible to upload the brain of an organism onto a computer? This question is the
basis of Whole Brain Emulation (WBE), a field which is attempting to do just that.

In pursuit of this, researchers start with a simple type of roundworm known
as Caenorhabditis elegans (C. Elegans). This worm is chosen because it's entire
nervous system consisting of 302 neurons has been fully mapped by researchers,
including its synapses. So in theory, this should allow us to just replicate the
worm in sillico and then be done with it?

Well turns out, it's not that simple.
