## Introduction

Is it possible to upload the brain of an organism onto a computer? This question is the
basis of Whole Brain Emulation (WBE), a field which is attempting to do just that.

In pursuit of this, researchers start with a simple type of roundworm known
as Caenorhabditis elegans (C. Elegans). This worm is chosen because it's entire
nervous system consisting of 302 neurons has been fully mapped by researchers,
including the synaptic connections between the neurons.
So in theory, this should allow us to just replicate the worm in sillico and then be done with it?

Well turns out, it's not that simple. The mapping of the neurons and their connections
is known as the connectome. This is akin to knowing the road layout of a city, that
doesn't inform you of the moment to moment traffic conditions, vehicles, pedestrian activity,
etc. at any one time.

Just some of the complexities are listed below:
- **Synaptic details:** The strength of each connection isn't captured by the basic connectome.
Also, each synapse can either be excitatory (encouraging the next neuron to fire), or inhibitory
(discouraging the next neuron to fire).
- **Dynamic Activity:** The strength of connections change over time through processes such as
synaptic plasticity, which is fundamental to learning and memory.
- **Neuromodulation:** The entire nervous system is bathed in a chemical soup of neuromodulators. These substances can change the "mood" of the neural circuits, altering the worm's behaviour—for example, switching it from a food-seeking state to a resting state—without changing the underlying wiring.
- **Embodiment:** A brain doesn't exist in a vacuum. It controls a body with muscles and receives feedback from sensors. To truly emulate the worm, we also need to simulate its physical body and its interaction with the environment.

This means that accurate emulations of an organism and its brain need to account for as many
of these properties as possible. One such holistic approach is BAAIWorm.

## BAAIWorm

BAAIWorm is an in-silico simulation of C. Elegans worms based on an integrative data-driven
model consisting of two sub-modules: the brain model and the body-environment model. The
goal of the project is re-create C. Elegans chemotaxi behaviour, i.e. the worm moving towards
a food source along a gradient.

This gives us an interesting simulation of C. Elegans moving in 3-dimensions in a fluid-like
space.

The simulation above is animating the exact data readout from the BAAIWorm simulator for it's
open loop demo data from [here](https://github.com/Jessie940611/BAAIWorm).
In the muscle activation heatmap shows how the worm is just executing the same muscular outputs
given some inputs, which validates the behaviour of the body and the environment.
