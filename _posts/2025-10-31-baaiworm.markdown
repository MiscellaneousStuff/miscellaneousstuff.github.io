## Introduction

Is it possible to upload the brain of an organism onto a computer? This question is the
basis of Whole Brain Emulation (WBE), a field which is attempting to do just that.

In pursuit of this, researchers start with a simple type of roundworm known
as Caenorhabditis elegans (C. Elegans). This worm is chosen because it's entire
nervous system consisting of 302 neurons has been fully mapped by researchers,
including the synaptic connections between the neurons.
So in theory, this should allow us to just replicate the worm in sillico and then be done with it?

Well turns out, it's not that simple. The mapping of the neurons and their connections
is known as the connectome. This is akin to knowing the road layout of a city, that
doesn't inform you of the moment to moment traffic conditions, vehicles, pedestrian activity,
etc. at any one time.
